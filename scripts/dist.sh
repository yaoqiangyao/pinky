# Builds what a release of Pinky ships, for scripts/release.sh and the
# release workflow (see docs/RELEASING.md):
#
#   scripts/dist.sh companion <out>   the companion APK, <out>/pinky-companion.apk:
#                                     the release build, signed with Pinky's
#                                     release key, or without the key the
#                                     development build (never to publish)
#   scripts/dist.sh darwin <out>      Pinky.app for Apple silicon and Intel Macs,
#                                     signed with the Developer ID, notarized and
#                                     stapled: pinky-<version>-darwin-<arch>.zip
#                                     (the updater's and Homebrew's) and
#                                     pinky-<version>-<arch>.dmg
#   scripts/dist.sh windows <out>     pinky-setup-<version>-amd64.exe (the installer,
#                                     which the updater opens too) and
#                                     pinky-<version>-windows-amd64.zip (the app's
#                                     files, to run it without installing)
#   scripts/dist.sh linux <out>       pinky-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz and the .deb
#
# The version is cmd/pinky/mygo.json's, which a release writes into a
# checkout of its tag first (go run ./scripts/release stamp <version>).
# Every app carries <out>/pinky-companion.apk, so build that first, its
# own FFmpeg (scripts/ffmpeg.sh): Pinky.app in Contents/Frameworks, the
# Windows and Linux apps next to their executables, built in a Docker
# container the first time, and its own adb (scripts/adb.sh): Pinky.app in
# Contents/Helpers, the others next to their executables, built with CMake
# on the Mac and in a Docker container for Windows and Linux.
#
# Environment:
#   SIGN             the identity that signs Pinky.app (default: the Developer ID
#                    of NATURAL SELECTION LABS); "-" signs ad hoc
#   NOTARIZE         0 skips notarization, for a dry run (default 1)
#   NOTARY_PROFILE   the notarytool keychain profile (default pinky-notary)
#   NOTARY_KEYCHAIN  the keychain that holds it (default: the login keychain)
#   FFMPEG_CACHE     where FFmpeg's builds are kept (default build/ffmpeg-dist)
#   ADB_CACHE        where adb's builds are kept (default build/adb-dist)
#   PINKY_COMPANION_KEYSTORE, PINKY_COMPANION_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
#                    Pinky's release key for the companion APK (a PKCS12
#                    keystore and its password), which only the release
#                    workflow has, in its secrets: see docs/RELEASING.md
#   PINKY_NO_COMPANION
#                    1 builds the apps without the companion APK, as this
#                    fork's Windows releases are for iPhones only.
#   STRICT           1 stops rather than leave out what a release must have:
#                    the companion APK signed with the release key, the
#                    Windows installer, notarization,
#                    FFmpeg's assembly for Intel Macs, FFmpeg for Windows and
#                    Linux (which needs Docker), adb (which needs CMake on the
#                    Mac and Docker for Windows and Linux)
