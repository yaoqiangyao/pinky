// Mounting the developer disk image, the step Xcode takes when it prepares
// a phone for development. Either way the image is personalized for the
// phone: Apple's signing server (gs.apple.com) signs its digests together
// with a nonce the phone made, and the phone checks that signature before it
// mounts anything, so only Apple's own image mounts. go-ios does the work;
// this file picks the way and keeps an image that is already there.

// install the developer disk image through it, as a cryptex.
