// Phones macOS's usbmuxd lost on Wi-Fi (driver.SetupDeviceService).
//
// usbmuxd lists a phone over the network when mDNSResponder reports the
// phone's _apple-mobdev2._tcp record as new. When its connection to a phone
// on Wi-Fi breaks once (its Wi-Fi turned off and on, a restart), it asks
// mDNSResponder to reconfirm the record, which fails on macOS 27.2 (-65541),
// and lets the phone go; it takes the phone back only when the record is new
// again, which for a phone that keeps it fresh is when it expires, up to about
// 75 minutes later (iphone-wifi-why, 2026-11-08). Meanwhile Finder and Xcode
// do not see the phone either, and `sudo killall usbmuxd` (launchd starts it
// again) brings it back at once.
//
// Pinky cannot get around it on its own: lockdown on the phone did not take a
// connection by the phone's address (port 62078 timed out, the record's port
// refused) while usbmuxd had lost it, and a second way to every service
// besides usbmuxd's would be a large and brittle part of its own. So it
// notices the state and lets the person restart the service: while it uses
// phones over Wi-Fi and one the person uses is missing from usbmuxd's list, it
// looks for _apple-mobdev2._tcp on the network itself (the package mdns, which
// asks and never answers), matches the instances' Wi-Fi addresses (the name is
// "<Wi-Fi MAC>@<link-local address>-supportsRP-26") with those in this
// computer's pair records, and lists a phone seen there for lostAfter in a row
// with SetupDeviceService. RestartDeviceService restarts usbmuxd through
// macOS's request for an administrator's password, only when the person asks.
